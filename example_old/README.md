# Pinwheel Flutter SDK Example

This example app is a working demo of the `PinwheelLink` `StatefulWidget`. To use it, you will need to add your API secret to [lib/main.dart](./lib/main.dart).

```
const String API_SECRET = "";
```

**Do not include your API secret in your app. You should fetch the Link token from your server.** To learn more about Link tokens, see the [Implementation Overview](https://docs.getpinwheel.com/docs/api/docs/introduction/Getting-Started.md#implementation-overview) section of our docs site.

For PinwheelLink implementation details, take a look at the repository's [README](../README.md).
